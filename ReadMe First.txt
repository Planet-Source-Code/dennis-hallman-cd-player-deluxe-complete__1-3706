This prgram was created by stitching thre or more sets of Visual Basic routines
together, the first one was the bog standard MS CD PLAYER Visual Basic
source code, then came the skin routines by DOS which I obtained from the Web
then came the REGISTRY STORE routines, also from the Web, these I added to and created the REGISRTY MOFULE to store not only the position of the form,
but also the Text Color and the Skin Path (see below), with lots of altering and
testing I finally came up with this Impressive program. I hope you all like it.
